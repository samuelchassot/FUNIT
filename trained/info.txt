3: with the reduced dataset (after freeing space on the cluster) see commit 58d203e6f71448ec88de05047d8eb4de7c03321c for the dataset, with night as test 
    (datasets are here: https://github.com/danielementary/Unsupervised-Image-to-Image-Translation/tree/main/dataset
        and they are in night_list.txt, rainy_list.txt, to_keep_sunny.txt, to_keep_cloud.txt)
4: same as 3 with more iterations
5: same as 4 with more iterations
6: reduced dataset with same number of images in all classes (set to the number of images in the smallest i.e. night), with night as test. intermediary tests during training
    (datasets are here: https://github.com/danielementary/Unsupervised-Image-to-Image-Translation/tree/main/dataset
        and they are reduced_cloudy.txt reduced_rainy.txt reduced_night.txt reduced_sunny.txt )
7: reduced dataset with same number of images in all classes (set to the number of images in the smallest i.e. night), with night as test. After 480'000 iterations
    (datasets are here: https://github.com/danielementary/Unsupervised-Image-to-Image-Translation/tree/main/dataset
        and they are reduced_cloudy.txt reduced_rainy.txt reduced_night.txt reduced_sunny.txt )

8: with retinanet classes: all classes are sunny, cloudy, rainy, night, cloudy_XXX, ... randomly attributed to test/train with a ratio of 85% in train. Problem: we want all nights as test, I made a mistake.
    after 230'000 iterations (see : commit dea96e03b7287ab54104d95de109cc39f102db38 on FUNIT
